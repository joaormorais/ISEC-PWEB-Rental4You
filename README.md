# ISEC-PWEB-Rental4You

I have been given a project to develop a web application using ASP.NET Core, C#, and SQL Server. 

The purpose of this application is to create a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that allows car rental companies to make their vehicles available for reservation through a common web platform in a convenient and efficient manner.

# Features:

There are five types of users:

● Unauthenticated user;

● Customer;

● Employee;

● Manager;

● Administrator.


The platform is divided into five distinct areas:

● Public area - unauthenticated users;

● Customer area - registered users with a customer profile;

● Employee area - registered users with an employee profile and associated to one or more companies;

● Manager area - registered users with a manager profile and associated to one company;

● Administrator area - administrator of the platform.


The separation of the features per areas was implemented to accommodate the different types of users and their permissions within the application. Users with different profiles will have different levels of access and functionality within the platform.
