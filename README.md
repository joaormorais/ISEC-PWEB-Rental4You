# ISEC-PWEB-Rental4You

I have been given a project to develop a web application using ASP.NET Core, C#, and SQL Server. 

The purpose of this application is to create a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that allows car rental companies to make their vehicles available for reservation through a common web platform in a convenient and efficient manner.




# Features that were proposed to be implemented:

Create five types of users:

● Unauthenticated user;

● Client;

● Employee;

● Manager;

● Administrator.




Divide the application into five distinct areas:

● Public area - unauthenticated users;

● Client area - registered users with a client profile;

● Employee area of a rental company - registered users with an employee profile and associated to one or more companies;

● Manager area - registered users with a manager profile and associated to one company;

● Administrator area - administrator of the platform.


The separation of the features per areas was implemented to accommodate the different types of users and their permissions within the application. Users with different profiles will have different levels of access and functionality within the platform.

# Features that weren't developed 

● It isn't possible to add images about the damages of the car to the details of a reservation

● It isn't possible to search vehicles filtered by dates

● It isn't possible to search for reservations with filters




# Known bugs

● None...



# How to use the application 

● The password for every default and already registered user is: Facil.123

● Register 2 users that you intend to use as clients (or use the "cliente1@isec.pt" user and "cliente2@isec.pt" user already registered)

● Register 2 users that you intend to use as employees (or use the "funcionario1@isec.pt" user and "funcionario2@isec.pt" user already registered)

● Login as an admin ("admin@localhost.com") and create one or more companies (this will create a automatic user associated to the company with the email "managerCOMPANYNAME@isec.pt". There are already 2 default managers of 2 default companies "managerMoraisCompany@isec.pt" and managerZeCompany@isec.pt)

● As an admin, go to the admin menu, select the permissions tab, and assign the permission to the clients that you have registered (the users registered by us already have the correct permissions)

● Login as any user and explore the features of the application 






# My personal analysis of the project

I enjoyed a lot working on this project, however, It could have been way better, by far, if I had more time to work on it. Since I had more subjects with more projects to be done, I couldn't focus on 100% on this project. Taking this in consideration, for what is done, I think it is very good.
It couldn't have been done this good without the help of my team mate and teatchers.
